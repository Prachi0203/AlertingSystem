Problem we are solving: 
Our vision is to avoid using doorbells instead when a person comes to someone's house he/she will look at camera then the camera sends notification to the user.
Solution we have made:
It detects the face using webcam after detecting the face it sends notifications to the user. If face is not recognised it does not sends notifications to the owner.
